We decided to develop SRE website for computer students who face difficulties finding reviews about the appropriate personal device or programs for their studies. The SRE website focuses on helping them to benefit from other studentsâ€™ experiences in the same field through reviews. Furthermore, the SRE website provide what students need by enabling them to display reviews and have recommendations that will simplify the search process and support them in finding the best options and be as constant reference for them, and help students find their purpose in less time and effort, as well as in a more organized and time-saving manner.
The main objectives of the project from the user's point of view are having registration process, searching about reviews, and providing programs recommendations. The team solution plan is doing Interviews and questionnaires to Specify the product backlog, then set the system architecture, design database, and develop and test the software.
